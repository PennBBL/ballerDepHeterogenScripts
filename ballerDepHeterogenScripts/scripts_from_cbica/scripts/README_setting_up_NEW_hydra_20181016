This file will tell you the 3 steps for automatically setting up Hydra scripts, making qsub command, and running qsub
Before this script, each of these steps would be done manually
Work flow is to take names of files that have been copied from home computer to chead to here in subject Data, make your specific script with paths to these files, as well as make results directories where your hydra output will go, run the scripts with appropriate input/output and get a qsub command list, and the source the qsub command list

*** in the future, may just weave directly running qsub command list into run_hydra_MATCHED script.  When debugging, it was nice to pull this out alone

*** GOOD NEWS, NOW, ONCE I GET MY FILES UPLOADED, I CANT MESS UP!!!!******

Step 1: make a list with all the file names in subject data (no full path) that you'd like to do hydras for
Step 2: csh copy_submit_script_NEW_HYDRA_20180925.csh <list name> <0 for no_resid, 1 for pre_match_resid, 2 for post_match_resid, 3 for covary with hydra, or whatever name you'd like> <num subjects> <date you ran analysis in format YYYYMMDD>
Step 3: csh run_NEW_hydra_MATCHED_with_cov_20180925.csh <list name> <0 for no_resid, 1 for pre_match_resid, 2 for post_match_resid, 3 for covary_with_hydra, or whatever name you'd like> <num_subjects> <date you ran analysis in format YYYYMMDD>
Step 4: more qsub_commands_to_run_NEW_Hydra_<num subects>_<type of analysis>_<date of analysis> #easiest thing to do is to ls qsub* and run most recent one.  This allows you to check before submitting
Step 5: source qsub_commands_to_run_NEW_Hydra_<num subects>_<type of analysis>_<date of analysis>
Step 6: csh run_matlab_script_NEW_HYDRA_20180925.csh <list name> <0 for no_resid, 1 for pre_match_resid, 2 for post_match_resid, 3 for covary_with_hydra, or whatever name you'd like> <num_subjects> <date you ran analysis in format YYYYMMDD>
